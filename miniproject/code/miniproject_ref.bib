abstract = {Phytophagous mites are serious pests in indoor and outdoor agricultural ecosystems and are controlled by synthetic pesticides. Pesticides adversely affect natural enemies and lead to environmental pollution, human health problems, harmful side effects, and risk of pest resistance. Currently, demand for organic and pesticide-free crops is rising in both developed and developing countries because of increasing public awareness of the direct and indirect effects of pesticides, food-borne diseases, and food security. In recent decades, the focus on crop production has moved from yield to quality, safety, and sustainability. To achieve this goal, the concept of integrated pest management strategies based on biocontrol agents has gained importance. Mite predators are important in integrated management of mites, particularly in complex crop systems where they may remove the need for any chemical intervention. Several kinds of mite predators occur in nature that can regulate mite populations. The fundamentals of a biocontrol program are to precisely recognize the pest and to find efficient predators using their life table parameters, foraging behavior, and trophic interactions. Using mite predators is often commercial because of the need of mass production and their large-scale releases to control phytophagous mites. Two important challenges in commercial biocontrol strategies are problems associated with marketing include benefit to cost ratio, limited number of retailers, producers unable to offer production, and problems associated with market demand affected by different issues such as public opinion, exaggeration of the results of biocontrol programs, and growers' knowledge. Governments and international organizations have important roles in marketing biocontrol agents by making strict rules benefitting biocontrol programs. To achieve this goal and to approach safety and security in crop production, biocontrol practices should be globally encouraged. Based on the high demand for safe food, a future high demand for using biocontrol agents is predicted. Therefore, more research and activity on different aspects of biocontrol as an ecofriendly practice is inevitable.},

abstract = {The functional response parameters and patterns of three coccinellid predators, Cheilomenes sexmaculata, Propylea dissecta, and Coccinella transversalis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were evaluated to find out how these predators respond at two different prey species across various prey densities levels. All three predators exhibited a decelerating curve Type II response determined by a logistic regression model. The linear reciprocal transformation of Holling's disc equation was used to further evaluate the parametric values. C. sexmaculata responded maximally, followed by C. transversalis and P. dissecta, in terms of consumption of the aphids, Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae, with suitable values of coefficient of attack rates and handling times on these prey species. Differences in handling times were found to be significant within and between the predatory species on both prey species indicating that predators respond differentially to prey species. Differences in coefficients of attack rates, however, did not vary significantly in most of the treatments. The potential role of these predators in biocontrol of A. craccivora and M. persicae suggests that C. sexmaculata is the best predator for the management of both prey species, particularly A. craccivora. However, further field based studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.},

abstract = {1. We derived a functional response function that accounted for both predator and prey size. Laboratory experiments were then performed to investigate the size relationships of the functional response of the benthic isopod Saduria entomon (L.) feeding on Monoporeia affinis (Lindstr{\"{o}}m) amphipods. 2. The S. entomon predators, in general, showed sigmoid (type III) functional responses. The attack rate of S. entomon was a bent ridge-shaped function of predator and prey size. The maximum attack rates of small predators were found on small prey, and then attack rate declined rapidly as prey size increased. In large predators attack rate increased slowly up to a maximum for large prey. The shape of the attack rate was dependent on the size scaling of predator and prey body mass in the attack rate function. We suggest that the ridge-shaped attack rate function found in our study is likely to be general for predators that feed on prey with a large size range. The handling time of small S. entomon increased rapidly as prey size increased. In contrast, we found only small differences in handling time of large predators. The complete functional response may provide size-refuges for very small and large M. affinis depending on the size-structure of S. entomon. 3. To investigate the realism in our functional response estimates, we incorporated the functional response in a consumption model based on the densities and size-structures of the predator and the prey in the field (Bothnian Sea). We adjusted the attack rate using a correction factor to predict the observed survival of the different age-classes of M. affinis from field samples. The field data-based consumption model accounted for 1 year of size-dependent predation by the size-structured population of S. entomon on M. affinis. In addition, using a growth model for S. entomon we checked that the predicted consumption by the predator gave realistic growth curves. We found that the experimentally derived attack rates may have been over-estimated by a factor of 400.},

abstract = {We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that realistically incorporates handling (i.e., attacking and eating) and digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our model, we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent further foraging activities (i.e., searching and handling). Instead, we let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator searches for new prey. Additionally, our model takes into account time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state, we term it the steady-state satiation (SSS) equation. The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e., asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time, for prey density approaching infinity). According to this formula, maximum predation rate is determined not by the sum of the time spent for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types: handling-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by handling time) and digestion-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by digestion time). We give examples of both predator types. Based on available data, we suggest that most predators are digestion limited. The SSS equation is a conceptual mechanistic model. Two possible applications of this model are that (1) it can be used to calculate the effects of changing predator or prey characteristics (e.g., defenses) on predation rate and (2) optimal foraging models based on the SSS equation are testable alternatives to other approaches. This may improve optimal foraging theory, since one of its major problems has been the lack of alternative models.},

abstract = {1. Comparisons were made of the functional responses of mature larvae of Perlodes microcephalus, Isoperla grammatica, Dinocras cephalotes and Perla bipunctata. Experiments were performed in stream tanks with natural substrata and glass bottoms, so that feeding could be observed above and below the substratum. There was one stonefly per tank and one of 10 prey densities between 20 and 200 larvae of either Chironomus sp. or Baetis rhodani per tank. Consumed prey were replaced in a first set of experiments but not in a second set. Additional experiments assessed intraspecific interference between larvae of each predator species (two to five predators per tank). 2. The number of prey eaten increased curvilinearly with prey density. The relationship was described by two models, a Type II instantaneous model and its integrated equivalent, for experiments with and without prey replacement, respectively. Handling time did not change significantly with prey density, and was the same for experiments with and without prey replacement. Estimates of attack rate were similar for the two models, but varied between prey type and predator species. Handling time varied considerably but was normally distributed for each prey type and predator species. Mean handling time varied for Chironomus from 39 s for Isoperla, which rarely ate a whole larva, to 57 s for Perlodes and for Baetis from 116 s for Perlodes to 167 s for Perla. All predators were more efficient at capturing Baetis, but the longer handling time for Baetis ensured that more Chironomus were eaten. It was concluded that these variations in attack rate and handling time were related to activity and growth differences between the predator species, and that experiments with and without prey replacement could both be relevant to the field, depending on how the predators searched for food. 3. In the interference experiments, mean handling time did not change with increasing predator density, but attack rate decreased curvilinearly, the decrease varying from negligible for Isoperla to marked for Perlodes. Prey capture decreased with decreasing attack rate. Therefore, interference reduced prey consumption, but this effect was negligible for Isoperla and increasingly severe in the order Dinocras, Perla and Perlodes.},

abstract = {Habitat selection is complex due to density dependence and functional responses, defined as variation in relative habitat use depending on availability. In this study we unite these concepts by empirically testing for density-dependent functional responses in habitat selection using a large herbivore, elk Cervus canadensis manitobensis, as a model species. Theory on density-dependent habitat selection predicts specialised behaviour when densities are low with a gradual switch to generalist behaviour (more even selection of habitat) as competition intensifies. This suggests that functional responses in habitat selection should be positive when competition is low, but that density may have a negative effect on the functional response due to constraining effects of competition on habitat use and availability. We tested this prediction using data from Global Positioning System (GPS) collared elk (n = 33) and empirical data on spatiotemporal variation in local density during winter in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada (2002-2011). As local density increased, winter home range size decreased and the proportion of mixed forest (providing shelter and forage to elk) used and available within the home range also decreased. Our resource selection function (RSF) revealed clear density-dependent effects in selection, being strongest (or weakest) for high quality (or low quality) habitat types at lowest observed density leading to more even selection as densities increased. The functional response in mixed forest selection was negatively affected by local density. Increasing availability of mixed forest in the home range was associated with higher selection at low density (positive functional response); no effect of availability on selection at moderate density (no functional response); and lower selection as availability increased at high density (negative functional response). Our study demonstrates that this process is largely driven by the negative effect of density on home range size as it constrains use and availability of habitat. Ecography},

It describes some potentially stabilizing features that have been found in real systems and shows the main stabilizing features discovered in the field of studies—refuges, spatial heterogeneity—or probably can be modified to incorporate them, for example, invulnerable classes of prey. It also touches two obvious features of reality, namely time lags, which destabilize the interaction, and density dependence (for example, resource limitation) in the prey, which is stabilizing. General model (the Lotka-Voltema equations) is also discussed and a criterion for estimating its stabilizing effect is presented. The chapter discusses the relationship between learning and functional response, and indicates the importance of two features, developmental response and numerical response, of the interaction. The chapter examines other aspects, namely the consequences for stability arising from the response of the individual predator to changes in the density of its prey (or to changes in the densities of two or more prey). {\textcopyright} 1975, Academic Press Inc.

abstract = {Trophic interactions govern biomass fluxes in ecosystems, and stability in food webs. Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 × 10 -14 kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
