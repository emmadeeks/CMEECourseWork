#Read in the bears data 
bears <- read.csv("../data/bears.csv", header = FALSE, colClasses = "character", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#1. Identify which positions are SNPs (polymorphic, meaning that they have more than one allele)
snps <- c() #Create empty vector 
for (i in 1:ncol(bears)){ #For i in each column of the data set 
  if(length(unique(bears[,i])) > 1)  snps <- c(snps,i) #If the length of each unique value in each column is greateer than one 
  } #Put unique values/position of unique value into a dataframe

#2. Calculate, print and visualise allele frequencies for each SNP

### SNPs are positions where you observed more than one allele
### the easiest thing is to loop over all sites and record the ones with two alleles

### this works to retain the indexes of SNPs; a smartest way would not involve doing a loop but using `apply` functions
cat("\nNumber of SNPs is", length(snps))

### reduce the data set
data <- bears[,snps]
dim(data)



## 2) calculate, print and visualise allele frequencies

### again we can loop over each SNP and easily calculate allele frequencies
frequencies <- c()
for (i in 1:ncol(data)) {
  
  ### alleles in this SNPs
  alleles <- sort(unique(data[,i]))
  cat("\nSNP", i, "with alleles", alleles)
  
  ### we have to make a decision on which allele to consider to calculate its frequency; 
  ### for instance, after we sort them, we can pick the second one (but the choice at this stage is arbitrary)
  
  ### frequency (of the second allele)
  freq <- length(which(data[,i]==alleles[2])) / nrow(data)
  cat(" and allele frequency of the second allele", freq)
  
  frequencies <- c(frequencies, freq)
}
### we can plot is as a histogram
hist(frequencies)
### or simply the frequencies at each position
plot(frequencies, type="h")


## 3) calculate and print genotype frequencies

### again, we can loop over each SNPs and each individual and print the genotype frequencies
nsamples <- 20
for (i in 1:ncol(data)) {
  
  ### alleles in this SNPs
  alleles <- sort(unique(data[,i]))
  cat("\nSNP", i, "with alleles", alleles)
  
  ### as before, I can choose one allele as "reference"
  ### genotypes are Allele1/Allele1 Allele1/Allele2 Allele2/Allele2
  genotype_counts <- c(0, 0, 0)
  
  for (j in 1:nsamples) {
    ### indexes of genotypes for individual j
    genotype_index <- c( (j*2)-1, (j*2) )
    ### count the Allele2 instances
    genotype <- length(which(data[genotype_index, i]==alleles[2])) + 1
    ### increase the counter for the corresponding genotype
    genotype_counts[genotype] <- genotype_counts[genotype] + 1
  }
  cat(" and genotype frequencies", genotype_counts)
}

## 4) calculate and print homozygosity and heterozygosity

### we can reuse the previous code and easily calculate the heterozygosity
nsamples <- 20
for (i in 1:ncol(data)) {
  
  ### alleles in this SNPs
  alleles <- sort(unique(data[,i]))
  cat("\nSNP", i, "with alleles", alleles)
  
  ### as before, I can choose one allele as "reference"
  ### genotypes are Allele1/Allele1 Allele1/Allele2 Allele2/Allele2
  genotype_counts <- c(0, 0, 0)
  
  for (j in 1:nsamples) {
    ### indexes of genotypes for individual j
    genotype_index <- c( (j*2)-1, (j*2) )
    ### count the Allele2 instances
    genotype <- length(which(data[genotype_index, i]==alleles[2])) + 1
    ### increase the counter for the corresponding genotype
    genotype_counts[genotype] <- genotype_counts[genotype] + 1
  }
  cat(" and heterozygosity", genotype_counts[2]/nsamples, "and homozygosity", 1-genotype_counts[2]/nsamples)
}


## 5) test for HWE, with calculating of expected genotype counts

nonHWE <- c() # to store indexes of SNPs deviating from HWE
nsamples <- 20
for (i in 1:ncol(data)) {
  
  ### alleles in this SNPs
  alleles <- sort(unique(data[,i]))
  cat("\nSNP", i)  
  
  ### as before, I can choose one allele as "reference"
  ### frequency (of the second allele)
  freq <- length(which(data[,i]==alleles[2])) / nrow(data)
  
  ### from the frequency, I can calculate the expected genotype counts under HWE
  genotype_counts_expected <- c( (1-freq)^2, 2*freq*(1-freq), freq^2) * nsamples
  
  ### genotypes are Allele1/Allele1 Allele1/Allele2 Allele2/Allele2
  genotype_counts <- c(0, 0, 0)
  
  for (j in 1:nsamples) {
    ### indexes of genotypes for individual j
    genotype_index <- c( (j*2)-1, (j*2) )
    ### count the Allele2 instances
    genotype <- length(which(data[genotype_index, i]==alleles[2])) + 1
    ### increase the counter for the corresponding genotype
    genotype_counts[genotype] <- genotype_counts[genotype] + 1
  }
  
  ### test for HWE: calculate chi^2 statistic
  chi <- sum( (genotype_counts_expected - genotype_counts)^2 / genotype_counts_expected )
  
  ## pvalue
  pv <- 1 - pchisq(chi, df=1)
  cat("with pvalue for test against HWE", pv)
  
  ## retain SNPs with pvalue<0.05
  if (pv < 0.05) nonHWE <- c(nonHWE, i)
  
}


## 6) calculate, print  and visualise inbreeding coefficients for SNPs deviating from HWE

### assuming we ran the code for point 5, we already have the SNPs deviating
F <- c()
nsamples <- 20
for (i in nonHWE) {
  
  ### alleles in this SNPs
  alleles <- sort(unique(data[,i]))
  cat("\nSNP", i)
  
  ### as before, I can choose one allele as "reference"
  ### frequency (of the second allele)
  freq <- length(which(data[,i]==alleles[2])) / nrow(data)
  
  ### from the frequency, I can calculate the expected genotype counts under HWE
  genotype_counts_expected <- c( (1-freq)^2, 2*freq*(1-freq), freq^2) * nsamples
  
  ### genotypes are Allele1/Allele1 Allele1/Allele2 Allele2/Allele2
  genotype_counts <- c(0, 0, 0)
  
  for (j in 1:nsamples) {
    ### indexes of genotypes for individual j
    genotype_index <- c( (j*2)-1, (j*2) )
    ### count the Allele2 instances
    genotype <- length(which(data[genotype_index, i]==alleles[2])) + 1
    ### increase the counter for the corresponding genotype
    genotype_counts[genotype] <- genotype_counts[genotype] + 1
  }
  
  ### calculate inbreeding coefficient
  inbreeding <- ( 2*freq*(1-freq) - (genotype_counts[2]/nsamples) ) / ( 2*freq*(1-freq) )
  F <- c(F, inbreeding)
  cat(" with inbreeding coefficient", inbreeding)
}
### plot
hist(F)
plot(F, type="h")
