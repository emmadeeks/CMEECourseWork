# This function calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree
# from its base and angle to its top, using  the trigonometric formula
#
# height = distance * tan(radians)
#
# ARGUMENTS
# degrees:   The angle of elevation of tree
# distance:  The distance from base of tree (e.g., meters)
#
# OUTPUT
# The heights of the tree, same units as "distance"
