    \section{Introduction}
        The Autocorrelation exercise calculate the correlation coefficient on temperatures in successive years. A Pearsons correlation test found the correlation between temperatures of successive years to be signfiicant (r = 0.326, n = 99, p < 0.01).
        When randomly computing the time series there were no correlatio coefficients higher than the significant correlation. This indicates a true significance from the analysis and further adds to evidence of rising temperatures.
